# Getting Started
## Choosing Hardware
### DIY
These may require additional parts for full functionality (antenna(s), battery, case, etc).

### "Prebuilt"
These options are easier to use out of the box/ complete packages (antenna, battery, screen, case, etc).

## Flashing Your Device
We recommend using the official [Meshtastic guide](https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/) to initially flash your device and get it configured.  Stable & alpha builds are available in the flasher.
Once you have the basics setup, check out out recommended settings.

Meshtastic updates frequently and it's a good idea to stay up to date with the latest stable build.
